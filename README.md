## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **mobile-focused software engineer** working across **Flutter, React.js, and React Native**, contributing to real client products across mobile and web platforms.

Currently at **Matrix Software Solution**, I work on multiple production-level projects simultaneously — building features, improving UI/UX, and strengthening code structure across 10-12 active client applications.

**What I Do:**
- 📱 Build **cross-platform mobile applications** with Flutter for iOS and Android
- 🌐 Develop **web applications** using React.js, Next.js, and Flutter Web
- 🏗️ Improve **code architecture**, maintainability, and scalability in production systems
- 🎯 Focus on **engineering fundamentals** and long-term growth over shortcuts
- 🔄 Handle **multiple client projects** simultaneously with Agile/Scrum methodologies

**Engineering Philosophy:**
I believe in **clean architecture, solid fundamentals, and sustainable engineering growth**. I prioritize writing maintainable code and understanding systems deeply rather than chasing quick wins.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Most of my professional work exists in **private client repositories**, which is why this GitHub profile may appear lighter publicly. However, my experience is real, practical, and production-driven.
